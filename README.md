it is a scissor paper rock game now only can be played locally amoung 2 players

todo:
1. give the players session id so reloading the browser wont effect the player.
    -> session id have been implemented but is half assed, need to make it so that the session id is stored with client.
    -> stored with client but wont be reused if the browser reloads (will be needing a game id also)
    -> the win or lose is being done using the sessionId stored with the client.
3. both player need to give the dicision in similar time interval.
4. also need to make it clear who won
